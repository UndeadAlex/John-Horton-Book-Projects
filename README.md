## Project 1: Timber
*Death to TREES i suppose*

Ok so this is the first project in John Horton's book, i mostly followed the guide but i chose to make some changes that i thought would improve the performance and readability of the code, *i am not finished yet but decided i wanted to work on pong*, so quick run down of what i learnt from this project, SFML standards, loading different assets such as (Textures, Sounds, Fonts), player input and using a enums.

I will return to this project later down the line, as i have a couple ideas to improve visuals with custom assets and the code readability.

## Project 2: Pong
*TODO*
## Project 3: Zombie Arena
*TODO*
## Project 4: Thomas was late
*TODO*
## Project 5: Space Invaders ++
